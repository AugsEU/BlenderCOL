# BlenderCOL
Blender plugin based on Blank's obj2col that lets you export collision files for Super Mario Sunshine.

# Setup
You need to put the btypes folder into \Blender Foundation\Blender\2.71\scripts\addons\
Then just install BlenderCOL.py as usual

# Notes
You don't need to triangulate the mesh, and you also don't need to merge into one mesh like you did before.
You do need to apply rotation/scale before exporting.

This program was based on a python script made by Blank. I just made a blender plugin to work with that script.
In future I will also get importing col files and editing col files.
